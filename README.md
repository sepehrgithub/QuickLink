# QuickLink

QuickLink! You Don't Need for Going and search for apps and download them because it takes a long time! so QuickLink is the solution!

QuickLink is a User Friendly (There's actually no GUI the app is still in Console (CMD) i hope you count it as a User Friendly App :D) app Which have Software names in it with numbers. You enter a number and it goes to the download link of that! so you dont need to waste your time and go find for their download links

(Going to be Open Source soon after Releasing Official Verison!)

Official Website: Soon ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

***Note: The App Is In Beta Version and May Not Work Correctly***
